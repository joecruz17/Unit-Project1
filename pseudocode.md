// create classes for both pokemon. Constructor consists of HP = 100, name DONE


//  turn = 1 (or -1) DONE


// have methods for each attack inside respective classes. Each attack does different damage based on types(classes) using if statements. ex: if target is Flying Type, the Spark attack method does double damage. Each attack has set damage
DONE


// ^ However if methods dont work, utilize a function for each attack.
add event listeners to each atk button and when they are clicked, call the button

// have each attack deal damage to the hitpoints(hp) DONE

// display via words what attack is being used when each pokemon is attacking. USE DOM

// display attack animation and/or sounds, if possible. USE DOM
