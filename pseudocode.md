// create classes for both pokemon. Constructor consists of HP = 100, name


//  turn = 1 (or -1)


// have methods for each attack inside respective classes. Each attack does different damage based on types(classes) using if statements. ex: if target is Flying Type, the Spark attack method does double damage. Each attack has set damage

// ^ However if methods dont work, utilize a function for each attack.

// have each attack deal damage to the hitpoints(hp)

// display via words what attack is being used when each pokemon is attacking. 

// display attack animation and/or sounds, if possible

// opponent uses random mov (metho or function depending on which works best)

// if pokemons HP === zero the battle is over and a display message appears "Pidgey Fainted. You beat Youngster Joey. You win $$$"
